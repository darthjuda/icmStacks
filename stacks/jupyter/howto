This command pulls the jupyter/all-spark-notebook image currently tagged latest from Docker Hub if an image tagged latest is not already present on the local host. It then starts a container named 
notebook running a JupyterLab server and exposes the server on a randomly selected port.

docker run -d -P --name notebook jupyter/all-spark-notebook
The assigned port and notebook server token are visible using other Docker commands.

# get the random host port assigned to the container port 8888
docker port notebook 8888
0.0.0.0:32769

# get the notebook token from the logs
docker logs --tail 3 notebook
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=15914ca95f495075c0aa7d0e060f1a78b6d94f70ea373b00
Together, the URL to visit on the host machine to access the server in this case is http://localhost:32769?token=15914ca95f495075c0aa7d0e060f1a78b6d94f70ea373b00.

The container runs in the background until stopped and/or removed by additional Docker commands.

# stop the container
docker stop notebook
notebook

# remove the container permanently
docker rm notebook
notebook
